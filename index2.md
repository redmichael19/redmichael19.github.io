# Introduction

Hello, welcome to my portfolio where you can find all my coding adventures.  

This is my first experience coding in any language so join me on my journey as I learn to code.

I am primarily interested in wildlife conservation and environmental applictions. 

# My First Agent Based Model

I have created a simple Agent Based Model (ABM). 

It is currently able to do the following:

* build agents in a space
* get the agents to interact with each other
* read in environmental data
* gets agents to interact with the environment
* randomises the order of agent actions
* displays the model as an animation
* is contained within a GUI
* is initialised with data from the web

The agents move randomly through the environment and eat food. 
The food is removed from the environment and is stored with the agent.
When an agent is full of food (100), the agent is sick and the food is added back to the environment.
If two or more agents are within proximity of each other, they share their store with each other so they all have the same amount of food.
